My name is Youssef el habchi, from [React Native Master](https://reactnativemaster.com) I have recently wrote an article exploring how to render an Html view in react native, by making a blog post example. and this repository contains the code I have used, feel free to use it in your project and share it with your peers, if you feel like reading the article, which I recommend follow this link [React Native Html View Example](https://reactnativemaster.com/react-native-html-view-example/)
If you would like to try the app on Expo, I have prepared an [Expo.io Project](https://expo.io/@alhydra/react-native-html)
